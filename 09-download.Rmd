# The data

All files used to build this site can be found on the associated [GitHub](https://gitlab.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR) 
page.

Additionally, you can download a convenient CSV file of the data

 * Conferences: https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/events.csv
 * User Groups: https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/groups.csv

The R scripts used to generate these CSV files are also located in the GitHub repo

> https://github.com/jumpingrivers/meetingsR/tree/master/R

These scripts were initially created via the [eRum competition](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/free-ticket-to-erum/)
